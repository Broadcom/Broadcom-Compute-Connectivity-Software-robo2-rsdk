/*
 *   Function
 *      shr_aidxres_list_create
 *   Purpose
 *      Create an aligned/contiguous_blocked banked free list
 *   Parameters
 *      (out) shr_aidxres_list_handle_t *list = place to put list handle
 *      (in) shr_aidxres_element_t first = number of first entry to manage
 *      (in) shr_aidxres_element_t last = number of last entry to manage
 *      (in) shr_aidxres_element_t validLow = low valid entry value
 *      (in) shr_aidxres_element_t validHigh = high valid entry value
 *      (in) shr_aidxres_element_t block_factor = max block power of two
 *      (in) char *name = name for the list (used for sal_alloc)
 *   Returns
 *      bcm_error_t = BCM_E_NONE if list created successfully
 *                    BCM_E_* as appropriate otherwise
 *   Notes
 *      The validLow and validHigh values are used to specify the valid range
 *      of entries for querying 'free/used' status of an entry; any value not
 *      in this range is considered an invalid argument, but values that are
 *      not between first and last will be permanently 'used' and not allowed
 *      by the free operation nor ever provided by the allocate operation.
 *      The blocking factor is the actual power of two that is to be used when
 *      computing maximum block size.  Blocks will be able to be manipulated up
 *      to 2^blocking_factor, but note that blocking_factor must be less than
 *      or equal to the number of bits used for bank index (so in 8b mode, this
 *      must be 7 or less, in 16b mode it must be 15 or less, and in 32b mode
 *      it must be 31 or less).

 *   Notes
 *      This destroys the list, but does not claim the semaphore first, so the
 *      caller must take care not to destroy the list while it's being used.
 *      It is possible that some OSes will not permit the destruction of a lock
 *      that is in use, so maybe that at least helps.  It is also willing to

 *   Notes
 *      This is truly an inefficient way to manage top and bottom reservations
 *      unless they are not known at list creation time, as this does not do
 *      anything to adjust the physical size of the list's workspace; it merely
 *      takes the requested range out of the available elements.
 *      Elements reserved in this manner can be returned using free; they are
 *      allocated a a single block.
 *      The block to be reserved must satisfy all allocation rules for blocks
 *      (for example, alignment and size) that apply to the list.
